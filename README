Repository containing the FPGA firmware for two FMC boards:
FMC ADC 130M (active and passive) and FMC ADC 250M (active and passive) firmware.
Currently it supports ML605 (Virtex6) KC705 (Kintex7) kits from Xilinx.

Synthesis Instructions:

  -> Go to a syn directory. It must have a top manifest file:
    cd /hdl/syn/path_to_syn_design

  -> Run the following commands. You must have hdlmake2 command available
      in your PATH environment variable (see https://github.com/lerwys/hdl-make2)

  -> Create the synthesis makefile and an ISE project

1 - hdlmake2 --make-ise --ise-proj

  -> Compile the source files locally

2 - make local

  -> Load the generated .bit file with iMPACT or other tool

3 - impact
