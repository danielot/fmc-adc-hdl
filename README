==============================================================================

Repository containing the FPGA firmware for two FMC boards:
FMC ADC 130M (active and passive) and FMC ADC 250M (active and passive) firmware.
Currently it supports ML605 (Virtex6) KC705 (Kintex7) kits from Xilinx.

==============================================================================

Synthesis Instructions:

  -> Fetch all remote modules

1 - hdlmake2 --fetch

  -> Go to a syn directory. It must have a top manifest file:

2 - cd hdl/syn/path_to_syn_design

  -> Run the following commands. You must have hdlmake2 command available
      in your PATH environment variable (see https://github.com/lerwys/hdl-make2)

  -> Create the synthesis makefile and an ISE project

3 - hdlmake2 --make-ise --ise-proj

  -> Compile the source files locally

4 - make local

  -> Load the generated .bit file with iMPACT script.

5 - cd hdl/syn/loader

  -> Execute script.

      <bitstream> will usually be one of the following:

      syn/fmc130m_kc705/kintex7_fmc_adc_130m_4ch.bit
      syn/fmc130m_ml605/virtex6_fmc_adc_130m_4ch.bit
      syn/fmc250m_kc705/kintex7_fmc_adc_250m_4ch.bit
      syn/fmc250m_ml605/virtex6_fmc_adc_250m_4ch.bit

6 - ./program_fpga <bitstream>
